@article{citeulike:2203614,
    abstract = {{A unified approach to the control of dynamic interaction between a
manipulator and its environment is presented in this three-part study.
Part I concentrates on the mechanics of interaction between physical
systems by considering the causal constraint on the control of position
and force, and by distinguishing between impedance and admittance. From
this standpoint a generalization of a Norton network is defined for a
broad class of nonlinear manipulators. Part II considers the
implementation of impedance control and presents a feedback algorithm
for imposing Cartesian impedances up to second order on a general
nonlinear manipulator. The algorithm demonstrates the solution of the
'inverse kinematics problem' in robot motion control to be unnecessary.
In part III a technique for choosing the impedance appropriate for a
given application using optimization theory is presented. Also, a
feedback control algorithm which permits a manipulator to avoid
unpredictibly moving objects without explicit path planning is
developed.}},
