This paper goal is to improove locomotion stability on quadrupedal robot Dynarobin, depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:Dynarobin}. The robot consists of four leg connected to robot body. Dynarobin has four identical legs, each combning three rotational joints: shoulder, elbow, and wrist, respectively. Additionally each leg containts mehanical spring which defines stiffnes to the contact surface.
