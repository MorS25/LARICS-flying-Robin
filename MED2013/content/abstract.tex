Compared to autonomous ground vehicles, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) have significant mobility advantages and the potential to operate in otherwise unreachable locations. Micro UAVs still suffer from one major drawback: they do not have the necessary payload capabilities to support high performance arms. This paper, however, investigates the key challenges in controlling a mobile manipulating UAV using a commercially available aircraft and a light-weight prototype 3-arm manipulator. Because of the overall instability of rotorcraft, we use a motion capture system to build an efficient autopilot. Our results indicate that we can accurately model and control our prototype system given significant disturbances when both moving the manipulators and interacting with the ground.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.
