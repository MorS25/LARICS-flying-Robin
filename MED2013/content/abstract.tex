This paper investigates how to improve locomotion stability of a dynamical system composed of four spring-mass subsystems by using a tail-like inertial appendage. The paper presents a Denavit-Hartenberg parameterization based kinematic model combined with a Newton-Euler based dynamic model of a two degree of freedom tail. Impedance based leg control simplifies the leg motion so that it can be modeled as a damped spring-mass system. The tail presented in the paper is used as a counterweight, capable of shifting its center of mass so as to balance the body of the robot. To that end, a recursive algorithm that moves the tail in order to balance the robot is proposed. A realistic robot model is built in the Open Dynamic Engine environment and is used to conduct a series of tests proving the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
%Compared to autonomous ground vehicles, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) have significant mobility advantages and the potential to operate in otherwise unreachable locations. Micro UAVs still suffer from one major drawback: they do not have the necessary payload capabilities to support high performance arms. This paper, however, investigates the key challenges in controlling a mobile manipulating UAV using a commercially available aircraft and a light-weight prototype 3-arm manipulator. Because of the overall instability of rotorcraft, we use a motion capture system to build an efficient autopilot. Our results indicate that we can accurately model and control our prototype system given significant disturbances when both moving the manipulators and interacting with the ground.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
