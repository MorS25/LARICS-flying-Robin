\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
 
This paper presents the use of a tail for quadruped robot locomotion in order to apply additional forces/torques to stabilize the motion during flight phases in which the robot has no contact with the ground. In order to simplify the complexity of the analysis, quadruped's main body is modeled as a system of four, equally displaced cuboid shaped bodies. By using the impedance control implemented in robot leg joints, complete leg behavior is modeled as spring-mass system.

Due to imperfection in design symmetry and leg dynamics iterative center of mass displacement algorith is introduced. The algorithm iteratevly navigates tail towards optimal position where the center of mass displacement is minimal and the generated rotation during hopping are negligible. Four tests shows that algorithm can compensate unwanted rotation after minimum 7-10 consecutive jumps.
