One of the chalanging tasks in biologically inspired robotics is to use tail to help robot locomotion in the same way as animal do. Ballance control while running and hopping, flight control or climbing are some examples how tail is helping animals to provide robust locomotion. The main reason to use tail in quadruped robot locomotion is to apply additional force/moments to stabilize motion gaits during flight phase when robot has minimal contant with the ground. 

Uniroo [x] is one of the first robot which uses single degree of freedom(DOF) active tail to maintain constant body pitch while emulate hopping kangaroo. A lizard-inspired active tail stabilization presented in [x] uses tail on wheeled car which provides robust drive over difficult terrain. The momentum based approach is realized also only for pitch control.
